Define a class AreaCalculator.

Inside the class, define overloaded methods:

    calculateArea(double radius) for circle.

    calculateArea(double length, double width) for rectangle.

    calculateArea(double base, double height) for triangle.

In the main method:

    Declare and initialize variables:

        radius = 5.0

        length = 4.0, width = 6.0

        base = 3.0, height = 5.0

    Create an object of AreaCalculator.

Call the appropriate calculateArea() method for each shape and print the result.
